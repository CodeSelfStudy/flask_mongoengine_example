# Sample Application

The goal of this application is to provide examples on how to use Mongo with Flask.

## Running It

* Create a Python 3 virtualenv and install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the populate_db.py file to populate the database with sample data: `python populate_db.py`
* Then run the application with `python app.py`

## TODO

* If a user doesn't exist, it crashes.

Feel free to fork it and do a pull request.
